Instruction of writing function: Each cell of function should include the following components
Statement of the function (a brief discreption)
Editor Name / Last Edited Time
Input (Arguments) Requirement (including an example of the input)

Function
Comments
Notice that the function should be in a seperated cell. After each function cell, there should be an example to call the function.
We use the underline form of function names: for example "get_company_data" (snake case).
Each function should be simple enough so that everyelse can read it easily. If a function is not finished, please adding a comment "#UNFINISHED" at the FIRST LINE of the function cell.
